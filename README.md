## Prerequisites

- Go 1.15+
- PostgreSQL
- Docker & Docker Compose
- SMTP

## Quick start

We can run this **Sentinel** project with or without Docker. Here, I am providing both ways to run this project.

- Clone this project

```bash
# Move to your workspace
cd your-workspace

# Clone this project into your workspace
git clone ...

# Move to the project root directory
cd Sentinel
```

### Run without Docker

Run the following command to execute the Go program:

- Make sure PostgreSQL is running and accessible with the credentials you provided in the .env file.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project.
- Create a file `.env` similar to `.env.example` at the **/config directory** with your configuration.
- Install `go` if not installed on your machine.
- Install `PostgreSQL` if not installed on your machine.
- Important: Open the `.env` file and modify the values of `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` to match your PostgreSQL configuration. Update any other configuration variables if necessary.
- Run `go run main.go`.

### Run with Docker

- Create a file `.env` similar to `.env.example` at the **/config directory** with your configuration.
- Install Docker and Docker Compose.
- Run `docker-compose up -d`.

## Project structure

### `config`

- Configuration. First, `config.yml` is read, then environment variables overwrite the yaml config if they match.
- The config structure is in the `config.go`.
- Reading the config from yaml contradicts the ideology of 12 factors, but in practice, it is more convenient than reading the entire config from ENV.
- It is assumed that default values are in yaml, and security-sensitive variables are defined in ENV.

### `main.go`

Core of this project (DB Connection, Excelize, Filtering and more...).

## Major Packages used in this project

- **postgeSQL go driver**: The Official Golang driver for PostgreSQL.
- **gorm**: The fantastic ORM library for Golang, aims to be developer friendly.
- **viper**: For loading configuration from the `.env` file. Go configuration with fangs. Find, load, and unmarshal a configuration file in JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, INI, envfile, or Java properties formats.
- **bcrypt**: Package bcrypt implements Provos and Mazières's bcrypt adaptive hashing algorithm.
- **testify**: A toolkit with common assertions and mocks that plays nicely with the standard library.
- Check more packages in `go.mod`.
